# MultiBlock API
A simple API for compatability with MultiBlocks similar to Doors and Beds

If your Fabric mod contains any blocks that occupy a space larger than normal, this API might be for you! It adds a simple interface which lets you provide the other blocks in your structure. This isn't very useful on it's own, but its main purpose is for mod comparability.

Simply implement `MultiBlock` on any Multi-Blocks in your mod.
